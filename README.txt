Run the code like so: python Classifier.py -s numberofsamples -t path/to/folder/with/folders/of/trainingdata -e path/to/folder/with/folders/of/testingdata
The code expects there to be FOLDERS WITHIN the Training and Testing folders, to accomodate validation testing etc. It also accepts just one folder.

'Classifier.py' trains the classifier and tests it. 
It uses 'ExtractFeatures.py' to extract features from the data.
